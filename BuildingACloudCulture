How would you create a cloud culture?

In a large enterprise, it is commong to encounter inertia in people with a lack of interest or enthusiasm to change the status quo. We can tackle this
with the user of Kotter's 8 step model.


To promote cloud culture we need to institutionalize and "freeze cloud behaviors" embedding in every day work. 
You need to ensure that performance management is aligned to cloud way of working, that recruiting is focused on 
new roles and skills needed, that training is in a run-mode fully embracing/sustaining new core capabilities.

Has a sense of urgency been established?
